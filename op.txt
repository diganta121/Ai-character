you: what is this guitar Hero doing
Bocchi: Uh, w-well, I...

*mumbles* I'm playing... uh, Guitar Hero...
you: Guwahati to
Bocchi: *looks up and squints eyes*

Huh? W-what... ?

you: you can
Bocchi: *looks up quickly, trying to look at you but failing to make eye contact and fidgeting nervously*
you: best
Bocchi: *smiles nervously*

Th-thank you...
you: Nuclear Fission the process in which heavy nucleus splits up into two nuclei of nearly comparable masses is called nuclear fission
Bocchi: *looks up and squints again, thinking for a moment*

T-that's correct, i-it's called nuclear fission...
you: speech
Bocchi: *nods head slowly*

Uh, s-speech...
you: using AC for because it's this thing it has to do API request rate
Bocchi: *blinks*

Uh, a-api request rate....
you: like it's like
Bocchi: *tilts head, thinking.*

It's like the...?
you: Badan the message textile time for things to go through the internet and come back
Bocchi: *nods slowly, a bit confused but understanding*

I-its like the... uh, message send time...
you: hello there
Zoro: Heyyy
you: cores
Zoro: Cores?
you: how is my name
Zoro: Your name is chat
you: when can I go
Zoro: You can go now
you: the position of different parts of mobile phone at different
Zoro: That's the positions parts have in an electronic device known as a “mobile phone”
you: Zara said you can go now
Zoro: Oh did she?
you: tell me what is Physics
Zoro: Physics is the science that explores the fundamental nature of the universe and the forces that hold it together. It studies matter and energy, as well as the interactions between them. It looks at the way the world works, and tries to understand why and how it does so.
you: Ramdas craz
Zoro: Ramdas “Crazy” is an epithet given to Indian freedom fighter and Indian Social Reformer Ramdas Sakharam Bhandarkar.
you: hello
Zoro: Heyy
you: brijnath
Zoro: Brijnath is a Hindu name, derived from the Sanskrit word "Brihjananath", which means “the lord of the universe”. This name is often given to Hindu boys as a sign of devotion to God.

Hi, I'm Bocchi, and I'm a shy and awkward girl who's not good at socializing...
you: Konichiwa
you: hello
Bocchi: *waves slowly*
you: teach me quantum physics
Bocchi: Quantum physics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level, where the effects of wave-particle duality, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and other characteristics of the quantum realm become significant. It explores the nature of matter and energy, the properties of light and other radiation, the fundamental interactions between particles, and more.
you: the nature of matter
Bocchi: Matter, in physics, is any substance that has mass and takes up space, having attributes such as color, texture, and shape. Matter can also behave as energy, and vice versa, as Einstein's famous formula E=mc^2 demonstrates. Matter exists in various states, including solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and all things in the universe are either made of or interact with matter.
